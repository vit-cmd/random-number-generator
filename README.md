# [Random number generator web app](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/random-number-generator-web-app-bz042v8kll)
    There are various use cases for a Random Number Generator. You could do a random dice roll or get a random quote. Most of the time, the implementation is relatively straightforward and similar to this projectâ€™s approach. In this project, we will create a dice roll simulation.
# Technology
- PHP
- HTML, CSS, JS

# Requirements
- An input box to assign how many dice to roll
- A drop down box to select the sides of the dice (for example d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
- A PHP rand(); function taking the inputs from the form
- An output to show # of dice rolled, the type of dice (d4, d6 ..), the total count of the dices rolled
- Output the details (number) of the individual dice rolls (Possibly using a foreach loop)
